    <h1>About me...</h1>
    <p> My name is Anthony Braun. I am a senior at Tumwater High School. My hobbies 
    include: computers, music, games, and marksmansip! I've always been facinated 
    by computers and how they work; that's why I wanted to take a Computer Science 
    class! I'm also taking this class because I want to be a game designer. 
    My favorite bands include Sabaton, Iron Maiden, and Motorhead. My favorite 
    hobby however is marksmanship. I've been doing that longer than almost anything 
    else, and I've become quite good at it. My favorite games include Battlefield, 
    Grand Theft Auto, and DOOM.
