    <h1>About me...</h1>
    <p> My name is Anthony Braun. I am a senior at Tumwater High School. My hobbies 
    include: computers, music, games, and marksmansip! I've always been facinated 
    by computers and how they work; that's why I wanted to take a Computer Science 
    class! I'm also taking this class because I want to be a game designer. 
    My favorite bands include: Sabaton, Iron Maiden, and Motorhead. My favorite 
    hobby however is marksmanship. I've been doing that longer than almost anything 
    else, and I've become quite good at it.
